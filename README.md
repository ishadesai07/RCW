# RCW --ROTARACT CLUB WEBSITE (CHARUSAT UNIVERSITY)
This website is based on the social service club which also brings people together to exchange ideas with leaders in the community, develop leadership and professional skills, and have fun through service.

## Motivation
We built this website to make it easier for students in our college to understand what rotaract club is meant to do and we serve to the community.

## Technologies 
The technologies we used to built this website are Bootstrap, Html, CSS for frontend.
and we used PHP in the backend.

## Contribution
My contribution in this website is just doing all the php work (backend work).
The frontend is done by my fellow mates! [Meet Desai]() and [Om Desai]().
